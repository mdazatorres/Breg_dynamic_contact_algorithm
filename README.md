Alessandro Bravetti, Maria L. Daza-Torres, Hugo Flores-Arguedas and Michael Betancourt.

The available files are:

#### integrators.py

Implements all the algorithms tested: classical momentum (CM), Nesterovâ€™s accelerated gradient (NAG), HTVI_adap, HTVI_d 
and Relativistic Bregman algorithm (RB). (see requirements.txt for a compatible set of dependencies).

#### examples.py
Contains the examples presented in the paper and additionals shown in the notebook (see SM Examples.ipynb)

#### plot_article_exs.py
Plot all the figures in the paper

#### plot_ex.py
Auxiliary function to plot in the jupyter notebook SM Examples.ipynb

#### SM Examples.ipynb
Jupyter notebook with several examples to show the RB's performance against other recent approaches.
